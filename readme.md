## Simple Language Reducer (SLR)

This project is to help students (like me) to have a deeper understanding about some
simple programming languages of our course Formal Semantics of Programming Languages.

### Languages

- [x] Lambda Calculus
- [x] Simply-typed Lambda Calculus
  - [x] typing
  - [x] reduction
- [ ] Operational Semantics

### Lambda calculus

- Substitute $\lambda$ with '>' to make it easier to type.
- Only variables with one letter is allowed!
- `checker.py` can check the syntax
- `reducer.py` can reduce expressions

### Simply-typed Lambda Calculus (STLC)

- Types can have multiple letters
- But variables are still one-lettered
- `term.py` gives you the basic typings
- `reducer.py` still uses the reducer from lambda calculus
